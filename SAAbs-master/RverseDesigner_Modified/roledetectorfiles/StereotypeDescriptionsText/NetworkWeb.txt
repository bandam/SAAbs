Package java.net Description

Provides the classes for implementing networking applications.
The java.net package can be roughly divided in two sections:

A Low Level API, which deals with the following abstractions:

Addresses, which are networking identifiers, like IP addresses.

Sockets, which are basic bidirectional data communication mechanisms.

Interfaces, which describe network interfaces.

A High Level API, which deals with the following abstractions:

URIs, which represent Universal Resource Identifiers.

URLs, which represent Universal Resource Locators.

Connections, which represents connections to the resource pointed to by URLs.

Addresses

Addresses are used throughout the java.net APIs as either host identifiers, or socket endpoint identifiers.

The InetAddress class is the abstraction representing an IP (Internet Protocol) address. It has two subclasses:

Inet4Address for IPv4 addresses.
Inet6Address for IPv6 addresses.
But, in most cases, there is no need to deal directly with the subclasses, as the InetAddress abstraction should cover most of the needed functionality.

About IPv6

Not all systems have support for the IPv6 protocol, and while the Java networking stack will attempt to detect it and use it transparently when available, it is also possible to disable its use with a system property. In the case where IPv6 is not available, or explicitly disabled, Inet6Address are not valid arguments for most networking operations any more. While methods like InetAddress.getByName(java.lang.String) are guaranteed not to return an Inet6Address when looking up host names, it is possible, by passing literals, to create such an object. In which case, most methods, when called with an Inet6Address will throw an Exception.

Sockets

Sockets are means to establish a communication link between machines over the network. The java.net package provides 4 kinds of Sockets:

Socket is a TCP client API, and will typically be used to connect to a remote host.
ServerSocket is a TCP server API, and will typically accept connections from client sockets.
DatagramSocket is a UDP endpoint API and is used to send and receive datagram packets.
MulticastSocket is a subclass of DatagramSocket used when dealing with multicast groups.
Sending and receiving with TCP sockets is done through InputStreams and OutputStreams which can be obtained via the Socket.getInputStream() and Socket.getOutputStream() methods.

Interfaces

The NetworkInterface class provides APIs to browse and query all the networking interfaces (e.g. ethernet connection or PPP endpoint) of the local machine. It is through that class that you can check if any of the local interfaces is configured to support IPv6.

High level API

A number of classes in the java.net package do provide for a much higher level of abstraction and allow for easy access to resources on the network. The classes are:

URI is the class representing a Universal Resource Identifier, as specified in RFC 2396. As the name indicates, this is just an Identifier and doesn't provide directly the means to access the resource.
URL is the class representing a Universal Resource Locator, which is both an older concept for URIs and a means to access the resources.
URLConnection is created from a URL and is the communication link used to access the resource pointed by the URL. This abstract class will delegate most of the work to the underlying protocol handlers like http or ftp.
HttpURLConnection is a subclass of URLConnection and provides some additional functionalities specific to the HTTP protocol.
The recommended usage is to use URI to identify resources, then convert it into a URL when it is time to access the resource. From that URL, you can either get the URLConnection for fine control, or get directly the InputStream.

Here is an example:

URI uri = new URI("http://java.sun.com/");
URL url = uri.toURL();
InputStream in = url.openStream();

Protocol Handlers

As mentioned, URL and URLConnection rely on protocol handlers which must be present, otherwise an Exception is thrown. This is the major difference with URIs which only identify resources, and therefore don't need to have access to the protocol handler. So, while it is possible to create an URI with any kind of protocol scheme (e.g. myproto://myhost.mydomain/resource/), a similar URL will try to instantiate the handler for the specified protocol; if it doesn't exist an exception will be thrown.
By default the protocol handlers are loaded dynamically from the default location. It is, however, possible to add to the search path by setting the java.protocol.handler.pkgs system property. For instance if it is set to myapp.protocols, then the URL code will try, in the case of http, first to load myapp.protocols.http.Handler, then, if this fails, http.Handler from the default location.

Note that the Handler class has to be a subclass of the abstract class URLStreamHandler.

Package javax.management.remote Description

Interfaces for remote access to JMX MBean servers. This package defines the essential interfaces for making a JMX MBean server manageable remotely. The specification of this functionality is completed by Part III of the JMX Specification, version 1.4 PDF document.

The JMX specification defines the notion of connectors. A connector is attached to a JMX API MBean server and makes it accessible to remote Java clients. The client end of a connector exports essentially the same interface as the MBean server, specifically the MBeanServerConnection interface.

A connector makes an MBean server remotely accessible through a given protocol. The JMX Remote API allows the use of different type of connectors:

The JMX Remote API defines a standard connector, the RMI Connector, which provides remote access to an MBeanServer through RMI.
The JMX Remote API also defines an optional connector called JMXMP Connector implementing the JMX Message Protocol (JMXMP). As it is optional, it is not part of this bundle (see note below).
User-defined connector protocols are also possible using the JMXConnectorFactory and, optionally, the Generic Connector (not part of this bundle, see note below).
Note: the optional packages implementing the optional part of the JMX Remote API are not included in the Java SE Platform but are available from the JMX Remote API Reference Implementation.

Connector addresses

Typically, a connector server has an address, represented by the class JMXServiceURL. An address for the RMI Connector can look like this:

      service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://myhost:1099/myname
      
In this JMXServiceURL, the first rmi: specifies the RMI connector, while the second rmi: specifies the RMI registry into which the RMI connector server has stored its stub.

The example above shows only one form of address. An address for the RMI Connector can take several forms, as detailed in the documentation for the package javax.management.remote.rmi.

Creating a connector server

A connector server is created by constructing an instance of a subclass of JMXConnectorServer. Usually, this instance is created using the method JMXConnectorServerFactory.newJMXConnectorServer.

Typically, a connector server is associated with an MBean server either by registering it in that MBean server, or by supplying the MBean server as a parameter when creating the connector server.

Creating a connector client

A connector client is usually created by supplying the JMXServiceURL of the connector server to connect to to the JMXConnectorFactory.connect method.

For more specialized uses, a connector client can be created by directly instantiating a class that implements the JMXConnector interface, for example the class RMIConnector.

Additional client or server parameters

When creating a connector client or server, it is possible to supply an object of type Map that defines additional parameters. Each entry in this Map has a key that is a string and an associated value whose type is appropriate for that key. The standard keys defined by the JMX Remote API all begin with the string "jmx.remote.". The document JMX Remote API lists these standard keys.

Connection identifiers

Every connection opened by a connector server has a string identifier, called its connection id. This identifier appears in the JMXConnectionNotification events emitted by the connector server, in the list returned by getConnectionIds(), and in the value returned by the client's getConnectionId() method.

As an example, a connection ID can look something like this:

rmi://192.18.1.9 username 1
      
The formal grammar for connection ids that follow this convention is as follows (using the grammar notation from section 2.4 of The Java™ Language Specification):

ConnectionId:
    Protocol : ClientAddressopt Space ClientIdopt Space ArbitraryText

ClientAddress:
    // HostAddress ClientPortopt

ClientPort
    : HostPort
      
The Protocol is a protocol that would be recognized by JMXConnectorFactory.

The ClientAddress is the address and port of the connecting client, if these can be determined, otherwise nothing. The HostAddress is the Internet address of the host that the client is connecting from, in numeric or DNS form. Numeric IPv6 addresses are enclosed in square brackets []. The HostPort is the decimal port number that the client is connecting from.

The ClientId is the identity of the client entity, typically a string returned by JMXPrincipal.getName(). This string must not contain spaces.

The ArbitraryText is any additional text that the connector server adds when creating the client id. At a minimum, it must be enough to distinguish this connection ID from the ID of any other connection currently opened by this connector server.
